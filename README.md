## What's that?

The idea was to parse any site with IT-news in order to find there some necessary articles.

This version of product is capable to parse only tproger.ru.

There will be a text field and a button. You can type "tproger.ru" or "http://tproger.ru" - it's not important. 

Now the program only displays links to articles with news. In the next wersion it will highlight necessary links.

## How to test

All you need is to have your local web-server and php installed. That's all.
